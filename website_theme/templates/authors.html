  <h3>Hi there!</h3>

  <br><br>


  <h2> <3 #1: Science & Computers</h2>

  
  I research <b><a href="./ouroboros-statement.html">Artificial Intelligence</a></b>, <b>Machine Learning</b>, and <b>Security</b> at <b>Apple</b>. Because <b>science is fun</b>, I am a machine learning collaborator at the <a href="http://hep.caltech.edu/cms"><b>Caltech HEP Lab</b></a>. 

  <br><br>

  I am passionate about the applications of Artificial Intelligence in the <b>perceptions of the human condition: being it in Security, Arts, Music, Science, Photography, or Telling Stories</b>. 

  <br><br>

  Formerly, I was a software engineer at <b><a href="http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/">Yelp</a></b>, I spent some softwaring retreat time at <b><a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a></b>, and I was an <a href="http://bt3gl.github.io/projects_page/index.html"><b>Astrophysicist PhD Researcher</a></b> at <b><a href="http://www.lanl.gov/">LANL</a></b>, <b><a href="https://www.bnl.gov/world/">BNL</a></b>, and <b><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/goddard">NASA</a></b>.
 
   <br><br>
  <br><br>

  <h2> <3 #2: Cinema, Photography & Fiction </h2>

  Back from my times as an Astrophysicist, I have been using pixels as a form of expression. Now, in my free time, <b>I make films at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_School_of_Digital_Filmmaking">San Francisco School of Digital Filmmaking</b></a>. 

  <br><br>

  Photography has always been a <b><a href="https://www.behance.net/bt3gl">gig in my life</b></a>, great part with film cameras. You can <b><a href="">check my artistic work here</b></a>.

  <br><br>
    
  I love reading <b>existentialist science <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58234920-marina-von-steinkirch">fiction</a></b>, and sometimes I try to <a href=""><b> write some pieces</b></a>.

  <br><br>
  <br><br>

  <h2> <3 #3: Adrenaline, Adventures & Appreciating the World </h2>



  My family is originally from Italy and Germany but I grew up in a small town in Brazil. Because of my studies and my PhD, I have lived in several places in the world, including: Sao Paulo, Chile, Boston, Washington DC, New York City, and San Francisco. 

  <br><br>

  These experiences gave me the sense of how <b><a href ="./youarebeautiful.txt"> beautiful humankind is</a></b>. We are all unique in our particular features, but very similar in our search to understand our presence in this reality.

  <br><br>

  I am crazy about new adventures, very fond of <b><a href="">shredding on a (surf/skate/snow)-board</a></b>, hiking around the world and <b><a href="">climbing</a></b>, and <b><a href="">skydiving</a></b>. 

  <br><br>
  <br><br>

  <h3>You own your life and you can be whoever your heart wants! Love!</h3>
