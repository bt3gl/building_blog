<h1><b>Hello World</b></h1>
<br>
<h4><b>Update: singularity.sh is a completed artistic statement about my computer-nerdy years, when I took the
	red pill in our Matrix. <a href="http://singularity.sh/mahalo-and-farewell.html">This is my goodbye post</a>. 
	So long, and thanks for all the fish.</b></h4>	
	
<br>
  I am <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/133713371337"><b>Mia von Steinkirch, Ph.D., M.Sc.</b></a> (formerly Marina von Steinkirch). I am a <b><a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/index.html">Theoretical High Energy Physicist</b></a> turned into <b>Machine Learning // Infrastructure // Software Engineer</b> and <b>Entrepreneur // Investor</b>.

  
<br><br>

	I started playing with <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">computer terminals</a></b> when 
	I was around 5, and by 8
	I learned my first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC"><b>computer language</b></a>. 
	<b>Science, Hacking, AI, and the Mysteries of the Universe</b> have been my main focus since then. 
	When I was 11, I wrote my 
	first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808185215/http://fly.to/bytegirl"><b>website</a></b>: 
	it had texts on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system"><b>AI Expert Systems</b></a> and <b>C++ snippets</b>. 
I started playing with <b><a href="https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=conectiva"><b>Linux</b></a></b> when I was
	in high school, and at that time I even <b>won first place</b> for a <b>medical diagnosis expert system</b> I wrote in 
	<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal">Delphi</a></b>, at the prestigious  
	<b><a href="https://www.mostratec.com.br/en/mostratec">Brazilian Science and Technological Fair</b></a>. 
	Later, in college and my doctorate, I learned how to apply <b>high-performance computational methods and 
	algorithms</b> to uncover the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything">Physics Laws 
	of our Universe</b></a>. I returned to computer science after starting becoming active in the 
	<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club">hacking</a></b> 
		<b><a href="https://www.defcon.org/">community</a></b>. I presented a
   talk on <b><a href="projects_page/qc.pdf">Quantum ♄ Cryptography</a></b> at <a href="https://cryptovillage.org/"><b>DEF CON's
		Cryptovillage</a></b> once</li>.
  
   <br><br>

   Stop for a second, feel your breath traveling your body, look around and realize the place you are - as an <b>entity with consciousness, and perhaps free will</b> - located at this very moment. We are all alive inside this astonishing World, full of complicated rules, and intricate beings. What are we all doing here? After wandering for many years trying to find the <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buqtdpuZxvk">Meaning of Life</a></b>, I realized that it's simply <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path">staying where reality is and be your best</a></b>. So, overall, over this timeline constantly moving forward (which we can't control), my purpose in this game is to <b>connect Science + Technology + Business Intelligence</b> to solve <b>impactful and meaningful problems for humanity and our society</b>.

<h3>Life as a Software Engineer:</h3>
  <br>
<ul>

<li><b>Many Hats Engineer</b> at <b><a href="https://www.reactioncommerce.com ">Reaction Commerce</b></a>, where I help developing <b>full-stack & infrastructure e-commerce solutions</b> (Node.js, React, GraphQL, Kafka, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, CircleCI, Docker, Kustomize, Kubernetes, AWS EKS, CDK, CloudFormation, Terraform, GitOps/Flux).</li>

  <br>
  <li><b>Senior Software Engineer</b> at

	    quantum gravitational theory on quasicrystals</b></a>. I designed a <b>High-Performance Computational 
	    environment for scientific simulations</b> (Python, AWS, Terraform). I modeled a high-dimensional Game of Life using deep learning to learn advanced rules and statistics. I
  developed <b>Python libraries/Jupyter notebooks for their quantum gravity theory</b>. I taught <b>Agile, JIRA, and DevOps practices</b> for a team of 10+ scientists.</li>
  <br>


  <li> My ol' <b><a href="https://github.com/bt3gl/Python-and-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures">book on
    Python and Algorithms</a></b> has been used <b><a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/open_leters.html"> by many around the planet</a></b>. In 2015, I signed
    with <a href="http://www.hanbit.co.kr/"><b>Hanbit Media, Inc.</b></a>, to have it translated to <b>Korean</b>. </li>



<br>

<li><b>CTF player</b> (in 2014).

On the back part of the step, toward the right, I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbearable brilliance. At first, I thought it was revolving; then I realized that this movement was an illusion created by the dizzying world it bounded. The Aleph's diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished. Each thing (a mirror's face, let us say) was infinite things since I distinctly saw it from every angle of the universe. I saw the teeming sea; I saw daybreak and nightfall; I saw the multitudes of America; I saw a silvery cobweb in the center of a black pyramid; I saw a splintered labyrinth (it was London); I saw, close up, unending eyes watching themselves in me as in a mirror; I saw all the mirrors on earth and none of them reflected me; I saw in a backyard of Soler Street the same tiles that thirty years before I'd seen in the entrance of a house in Fray Bentos; I saw bunches of grapes, snow, tobacco, lodes of metal, steam; I saw convex equatorial deserts and each one of their grains of sand...
