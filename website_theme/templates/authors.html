 <br>

 I went to <b><a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/index.html">Stony Brook University</a></b> to have
  my  <b>PhD in Physics  and Astrophysics.</b>
  I went to the <b><a href="https://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/en">University of Sao Paulo</b></a> to have
  my <b>BSc in Physics</b>.
  I have
   presented at scientific conferences such as the <b><a href="https://aas.org/meetings/aas221">American Astronomical
   Society</a></b> and the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/37753/"><b>CERN Winter School</b></a>.  I am also an

  and a <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/37753/"><b>CERN Winter School '09 alumni</b></a>.  I have been hacking, coding, and Linuxing since high school. Then I went to
  <b><a href="https://www.defcon.org/">DEF CON</a></b> and fell in love with <i>hacking this Matrix</i>. I presented a
   talk on <b><a href="projects_page/qc.pdf">quantum ♄ cryptography at the Cryptovillage once</a></b>.
<br><br>


 My <b><a href="https://github.com/bt3gl/Python-and-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures">book on
   Python and Algorithms</a></b> has been used <b><a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/open_leters.html"> by many around the world</a></b>. In 2017, I signed
   with <a href="http://www.hanbit.co.kr/"><b>Hanbit Media, Inc.</b></a> to have it translated to <b>Korean</b>. My <b><a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/books/group.pdf">book on Group Theory</a></b> is now used as
   a text book by graduate students around the planet, including at <b>CALTECH</b> (at least, that's what
   <a href="http://pma.divisions.caltech.edu/people/maria-spiropulu"><b>Prof. Maria Spiropulu</b></a> told me).
   I also have an e-book on <b><a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/books/qft.pdf">Quantum Field Theory</a></b>,
   you know, what they research at Large Colliders :). I have several articles published in renowned
 <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.86.024908"><b>Nuclear</a></b>,
 <b><a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/832/2/102">Astrophysics</b></a>,
          and
 <b><a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/1249755/files/p533.pdf">Cosmology</a></b> journals and <b><a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/332006/744603/AbstractBook.pdf">conferences</a></b>.
          I also have
 <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/index.html#notes"><b>tons of whitepapers and tutorials</b></a> and <b><a href="https://github.com/bt3gl/">open source projects</a></b> on machine learning, algorithms, computer vision, astrophysics, computer security, particles physics, etc. Science is fun!</h3>

On the back part of the step, toward the right, I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbearable brilliance. At first, I thought it was revolving; then I realized that this movement was an illusion created by the dizzying world it bounded. The Aleph's diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished. Each thing (a mirror's face, let us say) was infinite things since I distinctly saw it from every angle of the universe. I saw the teeming sea; I saw daybreak and nightfall; I saw the multitudes of America; I saw a silvery cobweb in the center of a black pyramid; I saw a splintered labyrinth (it was London); I saw, close up, unending eyes watching themselves in me as in a mirror; I saw all the mirrors on earth and none of them reflected me; I saw in a backyard of Soler Street the same tiles that thirty years before I'd seen in the entrance of a house in Fray Bentos; I saw bunches of grapes, snow, tobacco, lodes of metal, steam; I saw convex equatorial deserts and each one of their grains of sand...
