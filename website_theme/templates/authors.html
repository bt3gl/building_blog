<h1><b>Hello World</b></h1>
<br>

  I am <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/133713371337"><b>Dr. Marina von Steinkirch</b></a>, but you can call me <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_(given_name)">Mia</a></b>. I am a former <b><a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/index.html"></a>Theoretical Physicist</b></a> turned into <b>Machine Learning // Infrastructure // Software Engineer.</b> 

  
<br><br>

I have been in love with <b>Science, Hacking, AI, and the Mysteries of the Universe</b> since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808185215/http://fly.to/bytegirl"><b>middle school</a></b>. Then I went to
  <b><a href="https://www.defcon.org/">DEF CON</a></b> and fell in love with <i>hacking this Matrix</i>. I presented a
   talk on <b><a href="projects_page/qc.pdf">Quantum ♄ Cryptography</a></b> at the <a href="https://cryptovillage.org/"><b>Cryptovillage once</a></b></li>.
  
   <br><br>

   Stop for a second, feel your breath traveling your body, look around and realize the place you are - as an <b>entity with consciousness, and perhaps free will</b> - located at this very moment. We are all alive inside this astonishing World, full of complicated rules, and intricate beings. What are we all doing here? After wandering for many years trying to find the <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buqtdpuZxvk">Meaning of Life</a></b>, I realized that it's simply <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path">staying where reality is and be your best</a></b>. So, overall, over this timeline constantly moving forward (which we can't control), my purpose in this game is to <b>connect Science + Technology + Business Intelligence</b> to solve <b>impactful and meaningful problems for humanity and our society</b>.

<!--
On the back part of the step, toward the right, I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbearable brilliance. At first, I thought it was revolving; then I realized that this movement was an illusion created by the dizzying world it bounded. The Aleph's diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished. Each thing (a mirror's face, let us say) was infinite things since I distinctly saw it from every angle of the universe. I saw the teeming sea; I saw daybreak and nightfall; I saw the multitudes of America; I saw a silvery cobweb in the center of a black pyramid; I saw a splintered labyrinth (it was London); I saw, close up, unending eyes watching themselves in me as in a mirror; I saw all the mirrors on earth and none of them reflected me; I saw in a backyard of Soler Street the same tiles that thirty years before I'd seen in the entrance of a house in Fray Bentos; I saw bunches of grapes, snow, tobacco, lodes of metal, steam; I saw convex equatorial deserts and each one of their grains of sand...
