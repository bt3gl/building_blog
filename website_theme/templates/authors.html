<h1><b>Hello there, Human! </b></h1>

<dl>
   I am <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/miashreds/">Mia (Marina) Steinkirch</a></b>, a.k.a
   <a href="https://github.com/bt3gl"><b>bt3</a></b>, and I am an <b><a href="https://www.miasteinkirch.com/">engineer, filmmaker, and athlete</b></a>.
 <br><br>


 Previously, I was a <b>Senior Infrastructure Software Engineer</b> at
   <b><a href="https://codeascraft.com/">Etsy</a></b>, a <b>Senior Software Engineer</b> at
   <b><a href="https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf">Apple</a></b>, and a <b>Software Engineer</b> at <b><a href="https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/">Yelp</a></b>.

 <br><br>


   I have been hacking, coding, and Linuxing since high school. Then one year I went to
   <b><a href="https://www.defcon.org/">DEF CON</a></b> and fell in love with Tech. I also presented a
   talk on <b><a href="projects_page/qc.pdf">quantum cryptography there once</a></b>.
 <br><br>

  I am a <b><a href="">Stony Brook University's Astrophysics PhD alumni</a></b>, a
  <b><a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center'14</a></b> alumni (former Hacker School), and
  an  <b><a href="http://portal.if.usp.br/">University of Sao Paulo's Physics alumni</a></b>.
<br><br>

 My <b><a href="https://github.com/bt3gl/Python-and-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures">book on
   Python and Algorithms</a></b> has been used <b><a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/open_leters.html"> by many around the world</a></b>. In 2017, I signed
   with <a href="http://www.hanbit.co.kr/"><b>Hanbit Media, Inc.</b></a> to have it translated to <b>Korean</b>.

<br><br>

 I have done research at places such as the
   <b><a href="https://www.lanl.gov/projects/national-security-education-center/space-earth-center/astrophysics-cosomology.php">Los
     Alamos National Laboratory</a></b>,
   the <b><a href="https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a></b>, and
   the <b><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/goddard">NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b>; and I have
   presented at scientific conferences such as the <b><a href="https://aas.org/meetings/aas221">American Astronomical
   Society</a></b> and the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/37753/"><b>CERN Winter School</b></a>.


   <br><br>
 My <b><a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/books/group.pdf">book on Group Theory</a></b> is now used as
   a text book by graduate students around the world, including at <b>CALTECH</b> (at least, that's what
   <a href="http://www.pma.caltech.edu/content/maria-spiropulu-0"><b>Prof. Maria Spiropulu told me)</b></a>.
   I also have an e-book on <b><a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/books/qft.pdf">Quantum Field Theory</a></b>,
   you know, what they research at Large Colliders :).
<br><br>

I have several articles published in renowned
 <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.86.024908"><b>Nuclear</a></b>,
 <b><a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/832/2/102">Astrophysics</b></a>, and
 <b><a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/1249755/files/p533.pdf">Cosmology journals</a></b>. I also have
 <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/index.html#notes"><b>tons of whitepapers and tutorials</b></a> and <b><a href="https://github.com/bt3gl/">open source projects</a></b> on machine learning, algorithms, computer vision, astrophysics, computer security, particles physics, etc. Science is fun!
