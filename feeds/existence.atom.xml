&lt;p&gt;Seven years later, I am back to Brazil. Not only the country, the land, the physical. I'm re-encountering an entire new microscosmo that has gigantically developed since I left. Slowly I have been feeling that old nostalgic poetry, and this gives me inspiration for my future selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My documentary about my dad's extinction and the meaning of life has been too cathartic. I have been having seconds thoughts about producing it every single day since I started it. And this is because I have chosen to live my life as a nihilist, turning any pain in absurdity. But I now can feel that the creative process is healing me, and this is fantastic. In the end I will be stepping up another degree in my artistic journey. I know, it sounds deep, but that's how I have decided seeing it. This project is in post-production and I will talk more about it soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, I have started a project named &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/album/4331182"&gt;Humanoids&lt;/a&gt;. My idea is making short interviews with people around the world, asking them their own meaning of life. We are, above all, the same race of humanoids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's clear for me now that I'm ready to go back to San Francisco, the place where I feel and call home. I am excited about this new and magic cycle in my ephemeral history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love as the best form of activism,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marina&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ps: Found the pictures above during my research. They are photographs of magic mushrooms that my dad took, circa 1989.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
