* [Starting DL with Jupyter](http://efavdb.com/deep-learning-with-jupyter-on-aws/)
* [DIY Deep Learning for Vision:  a Hands-On Tutorial with Caffe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UeKXVgRvvxg9OUdh_UiC5G71UMscNPlvArsWER41PsU/edit#slide=id.gc2fcdcce7_216_515)
* [Wide & Deep Learning: Better Together with TensorFlow](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html). *Can we teach computers to learn like humans do, by combining the power of memorization and generalization?*


## Papers

* [Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search](https://gogameguru.com/i/2016/03/deepmind-mastering-go.pdf). Basically:

	- Values networks to evaluate board positions and policy networks to select moves.
	- Trained with supervised learning from human expert games and reinforcement learning from games of self-play.
	-  NN playS Go at the level of state-of-art Monte-Carlo tree search that simulate thousands of random games of self-play.
	- New search algorithm that combines Monte-Carlo simulation with value and policy network.

* [Adversarial Examples in the Physical World (Kurakin, *et al.*, 2016)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02533v1.pdf).
