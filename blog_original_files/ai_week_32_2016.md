## News


* [AI’s Language Problem](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602094/ais-language-problem/?utm_campaign=add_this&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=post). "One reason that understanding language is so difficult for computers and AI systems is that words often have meanings based on context and even the appearance of the letters and words. In the images that accompany this story, several artists demonstrate the use of a variety of visual clues to convey meanings far beyond the actual letters."
* [Image Completion with Deep Learning in TensorFlow](http://bamos.github.io/2016/08/09/deep-completion/). Great detailed tutorial using a DCGAN.
