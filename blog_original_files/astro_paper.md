My last paper from my PhD research together with the **Los Alamos National Laboratory** was finally published in the [Astrophysical Journal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09937)!

We show results of spectral analysis of simulations of Neutron Star's atmospheres, comparing with data from objects known as X-Ray bursters.
