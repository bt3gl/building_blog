I'm talking about this day that was all about **love**.

I am not talking; I'm showing my pictures.

The [People's Climate March], which happened a couple of weeks ago in NYC, filled my veins with **hope**. No words are able to express what each of these pictures says.

The rest of the pictures (and in larger resolution) are [here (flickr)]. Peace.
