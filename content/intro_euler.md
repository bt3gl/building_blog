It was freezing outside, so I spent a week solving as much as [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) exercises I could. Now, this was a fun time!

Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational and mathematics problems! Check out [my solutions here](https://github.com/bt3gl/Project-Euler) (but give a try yourself first!).
