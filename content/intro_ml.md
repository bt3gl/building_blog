At Apple I had the chance to learn a lot of deep learning while working with the team that develops its DNN toolkit. Today I have open-sourced my **personal** studies:

* [🚀 My Resources for AI, ML, and DNN](https://github.com/bt3gl/Machine-Learning-Resources).
* [🛰 CUDA Studies for Deep Learning Problems](https://github.com/bt3gl/CUDA_Studies_For_Deep_Learning).


Additionally, when I was in my PhD I had the pleasure of doing [some nice work on Machine Learning](http://bt3gl.github.io/projects_page/html_files/ml.html) as well. Here is the open-sourced code for you:


* [💎Advanced Machine Learning](https://github.com/bt3gl/Advanced-Machine-Learning).
* [🍭 MLNet - Classifying Complex Networks with ML](https://github.com/bt3gl/MLNet-Classifying-Complex-Networks).
* [🔋 NetClean - Complex Networks Data-Cleanser](https://github.com/bt3gl/NetClean-Complex-Networks-Data-Cleanser).
* [🌺 NetAna - Complex Network Analysis Package](https://github.com/bt3gl/NetAna-Complex-Network-Analysis).



***Enjoy and let me know what you think! :)***
