**Embrace your vulnerability.**



## Things you should never apologize for ;)

#### 1. Removing someone from our lives that repeatedly crosses our boundaries. 

#### 2. Being who we are, and feeling our feelings. 

#### 3. Trusting our instincts, even if we can't explain it. 

#### 4. If we are not truly sorry. 

#### 5. Quality me time (taking care of ourselves). 

#### 6. Our opinion. There is no right or wrong *opinion*, just different insights. 

#### 7. Standing up for what we believe in.

#### 8. Living life the way we choose to, regardless of fitting in with other people's norms. 

#### 9. Making decisions about your own future that don't do any harm to anyone.

#### 10. Being sensitive.
