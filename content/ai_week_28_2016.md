## Papers

* [Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search](https://gogameguru.com/i/2016/03/deepmind-mastering-go.pdf). *"All games of perfect information have an optimal 
value function which determines the outcome of the game".* , Basically:

    - Values networks to evaluate board positions and policy networks to select moves.
    - Trained with supervised learning from human expert games and reinforcement learning from games of self-play.
    -  NN playS Go at the level of state-of-art Monte-Carlo tree search that simulates thousands of random games of self-play.
    - The new search algorithm that combines Monte-Carlo simulation with value and policy network.
