I still remember, back in 2015 at [Yelp](https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/), when I learned about [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). It was beautiful, like magic.

It kinda felt the same when I recently found out about [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/), a command line tool [recently released by Google](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/03/skaffold-kubernetes), and designed to make local Kubernetes development very easy, allowing for iterative local development against a Kubernetes cluster. Check this out:

* It runs as a binary in your local machine (e.g. [easy install with brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/skaffold), etc.).
* It uses `yaml` configuration to describe how your application should be built: you specify the Docker images for your service(s) and Skaffold will tag them and push them to any valid Docker image repository.
  
```
apiVersion: skaffold/v1beta9
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: gcr.io/k8s-skaffold/skaffold-example
deploy:
  kubectl:
    manifests:
      - k8s-*
```

* These images are ingested into your Kubernetes manifest and used to deploy changes to the clusters for every code change.
* Skaffold **watches your local development directory for filesystem changes** and automatically builds and deploy your application to any local or remote Kubernetes cluster.
* It is integrated to `kubectl` and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/gcp).
* Skaffold not only works on your laptop as a dev tool, it also lets you reuse the same `skaffold.yaml` file to do deployments to your clusters in your continuous deployment system.

In resume, Skaffold makes development very easy: all you need to do is run `skaffold dev` (local dev workflow: [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/), etc.) or `skaffold run` (continuous dev workflow: [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), etc.) to start the entire process, creating Kubernetes pod(s) in a cluster with the Docker images of your application.

In this single command, Skaffold:

1. builds container images (locally or remotely),
2. pushes container images if target is not local cluster,
3. updates Kubernetes manifests with image tags,
4. deploys your application with `kubectl apply`,
5. streams logs from the pods,
6. watches for changes in the source code and Kubernetes manifests, and  then repeat 1-5.


Cool, right? :)
