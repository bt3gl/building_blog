*To exist is to change, to change is to mature, to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly.* - Henri Bergson


In the last 4 years, I had the opportunity of working in many different software projects and environments. From large companies to small startups, I feel accomplished because I learned what I needed to become the engineer I wanted. And as I advance my career, it's clear that it's time to say goodbye to **[chmod a+x singularity.sh](http://marinasteinkirch.com)**. 



#### But it's fun to look back! So let's do this...



I started this website in 2014 when I was about to graduate from **[my Ph.D. in Physics in Stony Brook](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/index.html)**. Those were the days when I was so so thirsty about learning everything about computers! I wrote an entire book on **[Python & Algorithms](https://github.com/bt3gl/Python-and-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures)**, and I was playing **[CTF intensively and top 23th at CTFTimes.org](https://ctftime.org/team/3208)**. I had that üî• to learn everything and write about everything (hence the **[variety of topics that this blog has](http://marinasteinkirch.com/archives.html)** üòÖ). 



But my history of building nerdy sites with nerdy content goes way back in the day üòÉ I wrote **[my first Flash website when I was 11, it was called http://fly.to/bytegirl](https://web.archive.org/web/20070808185215/http://fly.to/bytegirl)**:

Funny how I had texts on AI and C++ and Java back then... Certain things don't change (but **MP3s** do ü§£).



Then I created another website when **[I was in college](http://marinasteinkirch.com/projects_page/index.html)**:

And then when I was in **[my Ph.D.](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/index.html)** (so many papers in this one!):

Finally, I wrote **singularity.sh**, and I feel like my journey has ended with style üëæ.



Thank you all for following my work, for reading my posts, and for cheering my story. It has been an honor to be here. 

**Mahalo,**
