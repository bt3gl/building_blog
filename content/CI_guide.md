**Continuous delivery** is a software development practice where code changes (in source control) are automatically:

* built (run build and unit tests), known as **continuous integration**,
* tested (deploy to test environments, run all the tests), known as **continuous testing**, and
* prepared for a release (deploy to production environment), known as **continuous deployment**.


To understand the first steps of this pipeline, check out an example of a cookbook for [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/): how to write a [Suricata cookbook](https://github.com/bt3gl/Chef_Example_for_Suricata/tree/master).
