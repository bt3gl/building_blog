Wanna try Kubernetes for the first time and don't know how to start? No problem! I wrote this quick guide to help some of the junior engineers in my team at Etsy to get started with k8s!

In this guide I will show you how to spin a quick Node.js server in kubernetes and to grasp some of its main concepts. Read on! [Here is the source code](https://github.com/bt3gl/k8s_security).

### Install kubectl

First things first, you will need to install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) in your machine or VM.

Make sure you have all the auths right:

1. Create a auth token and move to `~/.kube`
2. Create a config file and move to `~/.kube`


### Spinning up a Hello World node server in docker

Download [this code](https://github.com/bt3gl/intro_to_k8s/tree/master/node_server_example) and build the image:

```
$ make build:
```

Now, just run the container:

```
$ make run
```

Which is:
```
docker build -t  node_app_test .
```

Check whether the server is up:
```
$ make curl
```

```
$ make status
```


#### Other useful commands

Exec inside the container:

```
$ docker exec -i -t <container name from status> /bin/bash
```

Check images in disk:

```
$ docker images
```


### Pushing the Registry to Kubernetes

In a real production system, weâ€™ll want to build images in one place, then run them in the Kubernetes cluster. The system that
 stores these images for distribution out to the running containers is called a **container registry**.


Using a `yaml` Kubernetes files (for example, the one inside `node_server_example/` you can now deploy the image with

```
$ kubectl create -f  node_example_kube_config.yaml
```

Now you can create the service with:

```
$  kubectl expose deployment node-app-test
```
See the service at:

```
$ kubectl get services
```

### Clean up

Removing the service and the deployment when you are done:

```
$ kubectl delete service node-app-test
$ kubectl delete deployment node-app-test
```



## Useful General Commands

Checking out pods:

```
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=security
```

Checking deployments:

```
$ kubectl get deployments --namespace=security
```

Checking services:

```
$ kubectl get services --namespace=security
```

Get more information about a pod:

```
$ kubectl describe pod --namespace=security <pod name>
```
