So here is a story for you. A few years ago, after I left my career in Silicon Valley, I decided to [break bad](https://vimeo.com/262786853) 😂. I know, it sounds silly, but hey, I had fun. I spent almost two years being a full-time traveler (part-time remote-located engineer and part-time [having-so-much-freakin-fun](https://www.instagram.com/innermost.limits.of.pure.fun)).

Here are my top drone videos from those wild times:

## 1\. Hawai’i Aerial Reel

Living in Hawaii for almost 5 months in 4 different occasions freed my soul for good (whatever this means).

The droning in this "reel" is so so beautiful, and it was so much fun to film.

I will never forget those days 💖.

## 2\. Life is all about you & Not at all about you

I just love this song by [Zhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_(musician)). I can listen to it over and over.

But the droning in this video is also really special to me because it was my first summer in SoCal 🌴.

## 3\. Santa Monica Daze

I can't even.

Thank you, Godspeed-Z.

## 4\. Tiny Jaws

I always really wanted to go to Maui, it was itching.

So I took two weeks off my job at Surfline in Huntington Beach and just traveled to [a random hostel in Lahaina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/hakuna-matata-lahaina.html).

It turned out that I was on the other side of the island from [Jaws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peahi,_Hawaii), which was the place I really wanted to drone.

I longboarded for hours with my drone in my backpack and a killer hot sun on my face.

I almost died to find the place but it was soooo worth it 😎.

## 5\. Surf & Chill in Malibu

Malibu :) (and some credit to Godspeed-Z).

PS: I had a website miasteinkirch.com once and this was the opening (and 3k people loaded it? Waaaaat!)

## 6\. Haleiwa Dreams

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/272116715" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

One of the best days of my life was when I was living in Haleiwa.

Everything was magical and colorful.

Surfing was so tight.

This video is actually called mia's dreams ✨.

## 7\. Longboarding Haleiwa

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/269152192" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

OK, the surf sucks because there were no waves but this video still gives me the chills.

I was 100% happy and this is not easy as a human in 2018\.

Plus, Post Malone wrote this song for me. ☠️

## 8\. Go Skateboarding Day w/ Sierra Prescott

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/274809384" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

So I met this [crazy good and famous LA local skateboarder](https://www.instagram.com/sierra_prescott/?hl=en) and we hung out 🐰.

Good summer times with some badass LA gals.

## Bonus: These ones are just hilariously bad and good, I don't know 🤷🏼‍♀
