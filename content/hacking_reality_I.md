### Hello Humans,

After spending almost 2 years as a digital nomad, surfing and skateboarding the world, I have filled [the prophecy](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/The_Prophecy) and arrived at my final destination.

I am now a computer scientist researcher and software engineer manager at the [Quantum Gravity Research Institute](http://quantumgravityresearch.org). While working half of my time in our campus in Malibu, CA and the other half in our brand new space in Hana, Maui, I am starting our high-class high-performance computing group. Among the many projects we are focusing on, the main one is the simulation of our theory for reality, which is based in a discrete spacetime (just like frames in a movie, thought as the a the simulation we live on), on top of a topological quantum neural network. All without leaving out the emergent complex system phenomena that is consciousness. Intrigued? Stay tuned ðŸ˜œ 


Meanwhile, enjoy the weekly references and tips I will be throwing at you ðŸ˜˜
