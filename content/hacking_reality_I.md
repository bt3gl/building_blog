#### Aloha Humans,


After spending almost 2 years as a digital nomad, [surfing and skateboarding the world](https://vimeo.com/user82259228), I have now completed [the prophecy](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/The_Prophecy) and arrived at my final destination.

I am now a computer scientist researcher and software engineer manager at the **[Quantum Gravity Research Institute](http://quantumgravityresearch.org)**. 

While working half of my time in our campus in Malibu, CA and the other half in our brand new space in Maui, HI, I am starting our high-class high-performance computing group. Among the many projects we are focusing on, the main one is the simulation of our theory for reality, which is based in a **discrete spacetime** (just like frames in a movie, thought as **the simulation we live in**), on top of a **topological quantum neural network**. All without leaving out the emergent complex system phenomena that is **consciousness**. Intrigued? Stay tuned ðŸ˜œ 


Meanwhile, enjoy the weekly references and tips I will be throwing at you ðŸ˜˜

## Genetic Algorithms

Natural selection is the world optimizing for survival on Earth. Every life form on Earth is a solution generated by evolution's algorithm, which evolves a population of individuals over generations, optimizing for survival. This is a way to describe this algorithm:

1. The algorithm begins by creating a random initial population.
2. Select the fittest individuals to be the parents of the next generation (a score). Randomly select some of the non-fittest individuals to be parents as well, increasing the chance of finding a global optimum.
3. Crossover the selected parents, creating new individuals. There will be a chance that the child will have a random mutation of it's numbers.
4. Calculate the average population fitness. Rinse and repeat.
5. When the average population fitness is ~0 (or close to it), stop evolving.

This is the pseudocode:

```
START
Generate the initial population
Compute fitness
REPEAT
    Selection
    Crossover
    Mutation
    Compute fitness
UNTIL population has converged
STOP
```

[GA algorithm are known for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm), but they are still *hot* as an optimization technique. Combined with neural networks they can help to find the best hyper-parameters, by creating a population of many NNs and letting it evolve.

This is exactly what we are doing at QGR, I will be telling you more soon.
