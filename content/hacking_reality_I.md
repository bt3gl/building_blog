Natural selection is the world optimizing for survival on Earth. Every life form on Earth is a solution generated by evolution's algorithm, which evolves a population of individuals over generations, optimizing for survival. This is a way to describe this algorithm:

1. The algorithm begins by creating a random initial population.
2. Select the fittest individuals to be the parents of the next generation (a score). Randomly select some of the non-fittest individuals to be parents as well, increasing the chance of finding a global optimum.
3. Crossover the selected parents, creating new individuals. There will be a chance that the child will have a random mutation of it's numbers.
4. Calculate the average population fitness. Rinse and repeat.
5. When the average population fitness is ~0 (or close to it), stop evolving.

This is the pseudocode:

```
START
Generate the initial population
Compute fitness
REPEAT
    Selection
    Crossover
    Mutation
    Compute fitness
UNTIL population has converged
STOP
```

[GA algorithm are known for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm), but they are still *fun* as an optimization technique. Combined with neural networks they can help to find the best hyper-parameters, by creating a population of many NNs and letting it evolve.
