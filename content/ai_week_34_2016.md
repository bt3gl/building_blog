## Papers

* [Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343). New DeepMind's paper reviewing backpropagation, using a modeled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropagated error gradients. Backpropagation is a bottleneck in DNN, so the idea is instead to use an asynchronous estimator, that would be obtained by supervised training of another mini neural network (a fully-connected NN regressor with 0-3 layers). Some speedup was showed in DeepMind’s hardware, but still raising questions on whether this would add any improvement on low-end GPUs setup.
