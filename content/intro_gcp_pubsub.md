Everything in either in GCP or AWS these days and there is so much data from so many sources!

To try to make sense of all the logs from different sources on [GCP pub/sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview),  I created this little [serverless framework](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless) that that uses [Kafka streams](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) for alerting correlation on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

***Enjoy and let me know what you think! :)***
