## News


* [Using Keras and Deep Q-Network to Play FlappyBird](https://yanpanlau.github.io/2016/07/10/FlappyBird-Keras.html). Hands-on on Google DeepMind's Deep Q-Network.
* [Neural Networks, Manifolds, and Topology](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/). This is a 2-years-old article, but a very well-written high-level explanation of the topology of low-dimensional NNs. "*The task of a classification algorithm is fundamentally to separate a bunch of tangled manifolds.*"
* [Calculus on Computational Graphs: Backpropagation](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/). Backpropagation explained in a very well-written text.
* [Understanding LSTM Networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). Another hit :).
* [Visualizing Representations: Deep Learning and Human Beings.](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-01-Visualizing-Representations/) Another Christopher Olah's great post, now on NN's different layers representations, tanging some philosophic aspects of it.
* [Karpathy's t-SNE visualization of CNN codes.](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/cnnembed/) He takes the 50k ILSVRC 2012 validation images, extracts the 4096-dimensional fc7 CNN features using Caffe and then uses Barnes-Hut t-SNE to compute a 2-dimensional embedding that respects the high-dimensional (L2) distances. 
* [NVIDIA's Accelerating AI with GPUs: A New Computing Model](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/01/12/accelerating-ai-artificial-intelligence-gpus/).
* [Torchnet: Lighting the way to deep machine learning](https://code.facebook.com/posts/580706092103929/lighting-the-way-to-deep-machine-learning/). "*[Torchnet](https://github.com/torchnet/torchnet) is different from frameworks such as Caffe, Chainer, TensorFlow, and Theano, in that it does not focus on performing efficient inference and gradient computations in deep networks. Instead, Torchnet provides a framework on top of a deep learning framework that makes rapid experimentation easier.*"

## Cool Plots
 

*  Remember that the hidden layer learns a representation so that the data is linearly separable, so that's is how you do separate a spiral two-dimensional dataset using Tensorflow playground and Convnetjs:
	
With tanh:

With ReLU:
