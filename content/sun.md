*"Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind."* – Anthony Bourdain



2018 was a prime nomadic time for me. And droning time as well 💁🏼‍♀️.
