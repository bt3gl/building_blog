Do you want to learn Python? Do you want to learn algorithms by solving the exercises from [Cracking the Code Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529209451&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interviews)?

You got it! Check out [an entire (free) book that I wrote for that](https://github.com/bt3gl/Python-and-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures)!


***Update***: This book has been bought by [Hanbit](http://www.hanbit.co.kr/), to be published in Korean!
