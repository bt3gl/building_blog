Throughout my many years of hacking I have been accumulating so many resources: books, scripts, tools, how-to, etc. I realized it's time to share them!

Please check out my [gray hacker github repo](https://github.com/bt3gl/Gray-Hacker-Resources), where I have indexed everything by subject:

* CTFs and WARGAMES
* CRYPTOGRAPHY
* FORENSICS
* LINUX HACKING
* MEMORY EXPLOITS
* VULNERABILITIES AND EXPLOITS
* NETWORK and 802.11
* REVERSE ENGINEERING
* RUBBER DUCK
* STEGANOGRAPHY
* WEB EXPLOITS
* OTHER HACKINGS
* PEN TESTING
* MOBILE
* BOTNETS
